## 2026.10.25

- Fixed: plugin menus registered with `admin = true` (e.g. Skeleton, My Plugin) showed in the customer portal sidebar whenever an admin session was open in the same browser; admin and customer menus are now kept apart (`_menu_publish()`, called by `_admin()` / `_auth()`)
- Skeleton sample plugin now has both an admin and a customer menu with submenus (SVG icons); the plugin starter used slot names the templates never print (`DASHBOARD`, `ACCOUNTS`) and a submenu in a different slot than its parent, so its menus never showed - fixed, and the slot lists in the docs now match the templates
- Customer portal sidebar: plugin menus with submenus are styled (stray second chevron removed, font icons aligned with the built-in 24px icons, submenu indented under the parent label, long names cut with an ellipsis while the sidebar is expanded, chevron turns when the group opens)
- Default theme, collapsed sidebar: the icon rail scrolls when it is taller than the window (last items such as Community were cut off); each submenu flyout is one card with its title inside it, and long menus (Settings) stay inside the screen and scroll
- Dashboard data (dynamic metrics and classic widgets) is cached in `system/cache/dashboard/dash_*.temp` (folder is blocked over HTTP) for the dashboard TTL when Redis is not enabled or not reachable; the Refresh button clears it
- Dashboard, Services Status Matrix: a "Server Clocks" card shows the server (OS) time, PHP time and database time with their timezones, ticking live, with an "In sync" / "Clock skew" / "Timezone differs" badge
- Dashboard: the FreeRADIUS status no longer shows "Offline - Connection Error" on REST setups (freeradius-rest, no separate radius database). Without a radius database it is online when a FreeRADIUS process is running on the server (same `pgrep` check as the System Info plugin) or FreeRADIUS has called `radius.php` / written `rad_acct` within 24 hours, and the card says which
- Security: FreeRADIUS REST endpoint (`radius.php`)
  - `Password::chap_verify()` returned true for a wrong password and false for the right one; it now compares correctly (constant time) and rejects malformed CHAP input
  - Customers are always checked against their own (main or PPPoE) password; the "username = password" / empty-password voucher fallback no longer lets anyone in as an existing customer
  - Inactive/banned customers can no longer authorize, and are never treated as vouchers; a voucher login needs a real `tbl_voucher` row for the `radius` router
  - Strict constant-time password comparison (no `0e123 == 0e999` type juggling)
  - Optional shared secret (Settings > FreeRadius > REST secret): send it as header `X-Radius-Token` (`update request { &REST-HTTP-Header += "X-Radius-Token: <secret>" }` before `rest`) or add `&token=<secret>` to the REST uri; unset keeps the old open behaviour
  - Vouchers are claimed atomically, so two simultaneous logins cannot both activate one
  - Shared-device limit identifies the device by its MAC instead of a client-chosen field
  - Data usage counts `Acct-*-Gigawords` (sessions over 4 GiB were undercounted) and `Mikrotik-Total-Limit-Gigawords` carries limits above 4 GiB; add `&acctInputGigawords=...&acctOutputGigawords=...` to the accounting uri (already in the documented config)
  - Usage is summed in SQL once per login instead of loading every accounting row twice
  - RADIUS Redis cache is also cleared for PPPoE usernames on customer edit and delete
- Marketplace overhaul
  - Hub, plugins, payment gateways, themes and device drivers share one layout, filters, search and sorting (Free / Premium / New / Watchlist, Updates, Issues)
  - Hub-wide search across installed items and every store, with install buttons on results
  - Details drawer with README preview (GitHub), version, requirements, health, licence and update info
  - Watchlist: star store items and revisit them on the hub
  - Update detection for plugins, gateways, devices and themes; per-item Update and hub "Update all"
  - Automatic backups (zip, `system/cache/backups/`) before every install, update, convert and uninstall; restore, download and manual backup in Marketplace > Tools
  - Install safety: PHP syntax lint of the whole package, `requires_php` / `requires_extensions` / `requires_version` / `requires_plugins` checks, zip-slip protection, GitHub-only sources, writable-folder checks
  - Health: syntax errors and plugin load errors are flagged on cards and on the hub; broken gateways/themes cannot be enabled
  - Licence keys for premium extensions (`requires_license`, optional `license_check_url`); activation is blocked until a valid key is saved
  - Activity history written to `tbl_logs` (type `Marketplace`)
  - Custom store repositories (https `repository.json`) next to the official one; repositories may also publish `themes`
  - Scheduled sync + Telegram notification: `php system/cron/marketplace_sync.php`
  - Theme previews (`"preview": "preview.png"` in `theme.json`)
- Payment gateways and device drivers can use the folder layout like plugins
  - Gateway: `system/paymentgateway/<slug>/gateway.json` + `<slug>.php` + `ui/`
  - Device: `system/devices/<Class>/device.json` + `<Class>.php`
  - Flat files keep working; "Convert to folder" is available per extension
  - New `GatewayLoader` / `DeviceLoader`; gateway templates load by plain name or `pg:name.tpl`
  - Checkout, callback and payment-status code now resolve gateways through `GatewayLoader` (only installed gateways can be included)
- Old `?_route=themes` page now redirects to Marketplace > Themes
- Fixed: global `min-height:100%` rule collapsed marketplace cards; shadcn theme showed dark marketplace colours in light mode

## 2026.10.23

- Plugin & Theme System overhaul (Phase 1-4)
  - Folder-based plugins with `plugin.json` manifest (`system/plugin/<slug>/`)
  - `PluginLoader`: scan, load, enable/disable, convert legacy plugins
  - Converted 11 legacy plugins to folder style: `wga`, `semaphore`, `radon_rest`, all `hotspot_pg-*`
  - `register_submenu()` + manifest `menus` array support (nested sidebar menus)
  - Marketplace UI (`?_route=marketplace`) — activate/deactivate/convert/delete plugins
  - Plugin Manager renamed to "Plugin Manager (Legacy)"
  - `install.php` / `uninstall.php` lifecycle hooks
  - `update_url` version checking via GitHub releases API
